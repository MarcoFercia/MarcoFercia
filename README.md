# Hello, my name is Marco Fernandez Garcia
### I'm a Game Programmer specialized in Unreal Engine & Unity.

I studied 3D animations, games and interactive enviroments at Seville. During these studies I learn how to 3D model, animate and texturing. Also I learn a bit of C# in Unity and made my first projects.

After these, I'm studying Game Programming Master's Degree at U-Tad, Madrid. Where I learn a lot about C++ and video game programming. Also I learn how to use Unreal Engine and Unity.


Now I'm finishing Howl of Iron at U-tad center and preparing myself to start in the game industry.
